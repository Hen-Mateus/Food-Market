# FoodMarket App

This project was developed within the scope of the "Programming and Data Structures" course. The FoodMarket App is a grocery management application built using .NET Framework and C#. The goal of this project is to create a store that sells products across various categories based on specific themes, incorporating data structures, classes, and dictionaries for efficient functionality.

## Functionalities Implemented:

• Efficient Data Management: Reading and writing all data into text files, ensuring secure and organized management.

• Management of Products and Customers: Addition and removal of products and customers, along with the ability to add product stock.

• Sales Records: Tracking sales history and displaying purchases made by a specific customer.

• Product Display: Viewing available products in the store for customers.

• Ease of Purchase: Capability for a customer to make purchases on their behalf.

• Business Statistical Analysis: Determining the city with the most customers, average customer age, product category with the most items, and products with low stock.

• Financial Reports: Identifying the product generating the most revenue, the most expensive product, category with the highest spending, and the customer who spent the most money.

• Calculation of Average Prices: Calculating average prices per product category.

• Inventory Validation: Verifying the existence of a customer and a product based on the product code.

This project demonstrates my ability to create functional and efficient technological solutions, incorporating programming principles and advanced data structures to address complex business challenges.
